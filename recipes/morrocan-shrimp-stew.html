    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add carrots and bell peppers; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in garlic and 1 tablespoon harissa; mix well. Pour in fire-roasted tomatoes with liquid and stir to combine. Mix in tomato paste and remaining 1 tablespoon harissa until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour in stock slowly, stirring constantly, to ensure that all ingredients are well mixed together. Add garbanzo beans. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, 15 to 20 minutes. If stew appears too dry, add a few more tablespoons stock if needed.</li>
        <li>Add shrimp and salt. Mix well. Cover and cook until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 10 minutes. Be careful not to overcook the shrimp.</li>
