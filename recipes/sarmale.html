    <h4>Description</h4>
    <h5>Sarma, commonly marketed as stuffed grape leaves, is a type of dolma—a stuffed dish of the cuisines of the former Ottoman Empire from the Middle East to Southeastern Europe—comprising grapevine, cabbage, monk's rhubarb, kale or chard leaves rolled around a filling of grains (like bulgur or rice), minced meat, or both.</h5>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ¼ cups long grain rice, rinsed </li>
        <li>2 pounds pork loin roast, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 pound carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
        <li>¼ cup sunflower seed oil</li>
        <li>6 ounces parsley roots, chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium head cabbage</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place rice in a medium bowl, and pour boiling water over it. Let soak for 15 minutes, then drain.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the carrots, parsley roots, onions and tomato paste. Cook and stir until the vegetables are tender. Transfer the vegetables to the bowl with the rice.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 more tablespoons of oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork, and cook for about 2 minutes, just until browned on the outside. Transfer to the bowl with the rice and vegetables; season with dill and black pepper. Stir until everything is well blended. Set the mixture aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the leaves from the head of cabbage, and place them in a large pot with about 2 inches of water. Bring to a boil, and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, until tender and flexible.</li>
        <li>Remove the cabbage leaves from the pot, but leave enough in the bottom to cover. On each of the remaining leaves, place about 2 tablespoons of the pork and rice mixture in the center, and wrap the leaf around to cover. Place the stuffed cabbage leaves into the pot.</li>
        <li>When the pot is full, place a few boiled cabbage leaves over the top. Pour boiling water into the pot to cover the cabbage rolls, and place over medium-low heat. Cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes, until the rice is tender.</li>
    </ol>
